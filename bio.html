            <p>As the biggest city in the highlands, Inverness is usually the jumping off point for most folk.
                From there you can choose to head west to Strathcarron, then around the NC500 in a clockwise direction.
                However most travellers prefer to start by heading up the east cost towards John O'Groats and finish off their trip by taking in 
                the stunning scenery down the west coast.

                Be aware that a lot of these roads are quite narrow and some sections should not be attempted in larger vehicles and only by experienced drivers!
